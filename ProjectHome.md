EVDirectToWeb is a look & feel framework to be used with [Apple WebObjects](http://www.apple.com/WebObjects) and DirectToWeb. It is currently very much work in progress and by no means complete or even tested.

I use this framwork to build a DirectToWeb application in my spare time and I don't invest time in areas I don't use or need. So, you can take the framework as it is and use it. I'll add information on how to get started over the time. Right now, there is no documentation but the framework is used as any other: include it in your D2W project and you're mostly done. The rule system takes over.

Requirements to use this framework:

  * Apple WebObjects
  * A DirectToWeb project

and from [ProjectWonder](http://wonder.sourceforge.net)

  * ERExtensions
  * ERJars
  * JavaWOExtensions
  * ERDirectToWeb
  * WOOgnl
  * the AJAX framework

Consider this framework as an **unstable pre-alpha version**. It is good enough to learn from and bad enough not to use it yet ... ;-)

[You can find some screenshots here](http://web.mac.com/cug/iWeb/Kanada/D2W.html).

The other projects (Designer, EVCMS, EVExtensions, ...) are a use case for the EVDirectToWeb framework. It's an application that I build in my spare time for fun and for my wife to use. It contains some basic management for clinical trial information collected online, also surveys and some blogging / CMS capabilities. This application is only ready to use if you know what you're doing and have no more specific requirements. It is just a 0.1 release of a web app.

For example, the site [event-s](http://www.event-s.net) is driven by this application, it is also used as a data entry point for a clinical study daily diary.

**Warning**

I have just checked in EVMailUtilities. This framework is **not** ready for any usage, even testing. It is in very early development and only in this repository so I can work from several machines!
